## ReadMe for InfEx2020

This project focuses on detected three kinds of relationships, namely, **buy**, **work** and **part**.

Here, a combination of rule based and semi-supervised approach is used to extract information.

Please refer to the **Report_InfEx2020.pdf** if you want to understand the steps and approach devised during the course of the project!

Please note that you need to install the libraries below on your pc, before running my program!

**Libraries:**

-	Pandas 
-	Numpy
-	Nltk
-	Spacy
-	StanfordNLP
-	Itertools
-	PytextRank
-	Re
-	bs4 or BeautifulSoup
-	Collections
-	Geotext
-	Json
-	String
-	Os
-	Sklearn
-	En_core_web_sm
-	StanfordOpenIE
-	Glove Embeddings(glove.6B.300d.txt)

Also, for the glove embeddings, you need to go to : https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
and download “glove.6B.300d.txt” file and save it inside “Code” folder.

Place your files in “Dataset” folder. The all 3 Input files shown below will take all the files in this folder as input and output files of the format “relationship_docname.json”, corresponding to each input file. (Note:  docname is the name of files in the folder.)

I have 3 separate files for each relationship as follows:

**Input File 1:** final_buy.py :=> Run this to see buy relationship results.
**Output File 1:** buy_docname.json 

**Input File 2:** final_work.py :=> Run this to see work relationship results.
**Output File 2:** work_docname.json 

**Input File 3:** final_part.py :=> Run this to see part relationship results.
**Output File 3:** part_docname.json 

Please note that all outputs files generated during the program are stored in the output folder.

Thank you for reading!
