# Part of Speech Tagging with Viterbi Algorithm

Please run the program > POS_Tagging_with_Viterbi_algorithm.py

Type your sentence on prompt and press Enter.

It outputs the POS Tags for words in the entered sentence

This program is case sensitive. So, if you type “janet” instead of “Janet”, it gives error. If any word in your sentence is not in the given corpus, then it gives an error.

This program uses 2 files:

**Transition_prob.xlsx**

**Observation_Likelihood_prob.xlxs**

If you want to test the program against, different values, then merely change the values (like words, pos tags, etc) in these files and run the program.
