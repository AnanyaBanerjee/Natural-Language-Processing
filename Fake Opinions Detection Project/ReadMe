This project detects Fake Opnions and uses NYC Yelp Dataset.

The citations for that are mentioned in the document "Steps of Project".

The two datasets that we use are:
reviewContent.csv and metadata.csv

We first run Pj.py which merges these two datasets and produces "Reviews.csv".

We next run Proj_Preprocessing.py which pre-processes our dataset which generates a dataset "pre_processed.csv".

We then run Bow.py which does the rest and gives final results.

Thanks!
